# REST API: Interview 1

## Get Started

To start the project install dependencies:

    composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^9

Then start the dev server:
    
    php -S localhost:8000 -t 'public'

Write an HTTP GET method to retrieve information from an articles database. The query response is paginated and can be further accessed by appending to the query string &page=num where num is the page number.

Given a string of author, your solution must perform the following tasks:

1. Query <https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/articles?author=>authorName&page=num (replace authorName and num).
2. Initialize the titles array to store a list of string elements.
3. Store the name of each article returned in the data field to the titles array using the following logic:
    * If title is not null, use title as the name.
    * If title is null, and story title is not null, use story_title as the name.
    * If both title and story_title are null, ignore the article.
4. Based on the total_pages count, fetch all the data (pagination) and perform step 3 for each.
5. Return the array of titles.
6. Cache the results to avoid further requests being made to the API.

The query response from the website is a JSON response with the following five fields:

* page: The current page.
* per_page: The maximum number of results per page.
* total: The total number of records in the search result.
* total_pages: The total number of pages that must be queried to get all the results.
* data: An array of JSON objects containing article information
